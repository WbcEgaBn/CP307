### Quality Analysis Tests

This file provides a series of tests that are based off the **Louvain Method**, **Girvan-Newman Method**, and the **Infomap Algorithm** which were implemented in Python using the help of **NetworkX**.

Please make sure your algorithms can handle different types of graphs. There will not be any disconnected or directed graphs. Tests will be done on sparse graphs (E≈V) and dense graphs (E≈V^2). Methods should look to return the algorithm's compute time, and a dictionary with keys being the index and values being the vertices.
